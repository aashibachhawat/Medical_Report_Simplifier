Mr. Sharma (age 52) was in the hospital from August 20th to 25th, 2025.  He has type 2 diabetes that hasn't been well controlled, along with high blood pressure.  A heart ultrasound showed a slightly enlarged heart muscle.

For three months, he'd been experiencing increased urination, thirst, and tiredness. He doesn't have chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. He's had diabetes for 10 years and high blood pressure for 5 years, but hasn't always taken his medicine regularly.

His blood pressure was high (160/100) during his stay.  His blood sugar levels were also very high (fasting: 196, after meal: 278). His heart exam showed an extra heart sound.

We restarted his diabetes medication (Metformin) and added a new blood pressure medicine (Amlodipine). We also talked to him about improving his lifestyle – eating a healthier diet (low salt, diabetic-friendly), exercising, and losing weight.

He needs to continue taking his medicines as prescribed and return to the clinic in four weeks for a blood sugar check.  Weight loss is also recommended.
